# Frank

Frank is a program that assists your aim in Phantom Forces via using the Ballistics Tracker. The way this is accomplished is by scanning the screen for pixels of a specific color, that being the Ballistics Tracker, and moving the mouse directly there.

## Things to know:

* You should fullscreen your ROBLOX game while using Frank, or the assist will be slightly off.
* It will only assist if the Ballistics Tracker diamond can be seen above a player's head. This means you do in fact have to aim at an enemy.

## How do I use it?
Run the executable, and fullscreen ROBLOX. All you need next is a gun with a Ballistics Tracker.
